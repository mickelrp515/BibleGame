        Esther was a young Jewish orphan raised by her cousin Mordecai. When Queen Vashti refused to appear before King Xerxes (also known as Ahasuerus) during a royal banquet, the king removed her from her position and launched a search for a new queen.

        Esther was taken to the palace and, after undergoing a 12-month beautification process, she was presented to the king. He was more pleased with Esther than any of the others and crowned her queen. At Mordecai‚Äôs instruction, Esther kept her Jewish identity secret.

        While stationed at the king‚Äôs gate, Mordecai overheard a plot by two royal officials‚ÄîBigthan and Teresh‚Äîto assassinate the king. He informed Esther, who passed the warning to Xerxes. After an investigation, the plot was confirmed, and the conspirators were executed. Mordecai‚Äôs act of loyalty was recorded in the royal chronicles, though no reward was given at the time.

        Infuriated, Haman sought revenge‚Äînot just on Mordecai, but on all Jews throughout the empire. He convinced Xerxes to issue a royal decree to annihilate every Jew, young and old, on a specific day. The king agreed, unaware of Esther‚Äôs heritage, and sealed it with his signet ring.

        When Mordecai learned of the decree, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went into public mourning. He sent word to Esther, urging her to go before the king and plead for her people‚Äôs lives‚Äîdespite the risk of death for appearing uninvited.
